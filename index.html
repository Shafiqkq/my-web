  <h1>“We’ve Had Enough”: Indonesians Rise Up After Police Kill Young Worker</h1>
  <p>Across Indonesia, ordinary people are flooding the streets after the tragic death of Affan Kurniawan, a 21-year-old delivery driver crushed by a police armored vehicle during a protest. For many, his death symbolizes years of frustration — rising costs of living, lawmakers enjoying lavish perks, and a widening gap between the elite and the people. The anger has turned into flames: government buildings torched, officials’ houses attacked, and crowds demanding dignity and justice. “They live in luxury while we suffer,” shouted one protester, reflecting a movement that now feels unstoppable.</p>
