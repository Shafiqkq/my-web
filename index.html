  <h1>“We’ve Had Enough”: Indonesians Rise Up After Police Kill Young Worker</h1>
   <p>Across Indonesia, ordinary people are flooding the streets after the tragic death of Affan Kurniawan, a 21-year-old delivery driver crushed by a police armored vehicle during a protest. For many, his death symbolizes years of frustration — rising costs of living, lawmakers enjoying lavish perks, and a widening gap between the elite and the people. The anger has turned into flames: government buildings torched, officials’ houses attacked, and crowds demanding dignity and justice. “They live in luxury while we suffer,” shouted one protester, reflecting a movement that now feels unstoppable.</p>

         <h2>“They call us stupid, but they steal millions”</h2>
         <p>Ahmad Sahroni calling us <b>“stupid, damn.”</b> So folks went straight to their houses, broke in, looted stuff, and sprayed angry words on the walls. While the country is burning, many of those parliament guys just ran abroad, pretending nothing is happening.

The truth is, <em>DPR members</em> get only about 4–5 million rupiah as a basic salary, but with allowances and extra perks their income jumps into the <strong>hundreds of millions</strong>. Meanwhile, Sri Mulyani raised taxes on ordinary people but let DPR members stay exempt. That’s not just unfair — that’s spitting in people’s faces. No wonder people lost their patience and took justice into their own hands.</p>

Flanked by party leaders, including PDI-P chair Megawati Soekarnoputri, Mr Prabowo said party leaders have “taken firm action” against their MPs, and sanctions will take effect from Monday. He said the right to peaceful assembly must be protected, but warned that violence, including looting and destruction of facilities, would not be tolerated. #indonesia #indonesianews #prabowosubianto #indonesiaprotests</p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound  - CNA" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-CNA-7544693289300134672?refer=embed">♬ original sound  - CNA</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
